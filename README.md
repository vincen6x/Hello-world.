# Hello-world.
i commit to learn github and code.
i have been working as a linux system admin for so many years
and now i want to change my career. I believed Devops is the next move
that I think is my goals in the next couple of years. I commit to spend at least 
four hours a day to learn to become a Devops engineer.
